# Transcript: Shriveai
Creation complete: Elf Rogue Urchin.
Ability scores: Str 8, Dex 19, Con 16, Int 16, Wis 15, Cha 8.
Inventory: 
Leather armor, Rapier, Shortbow (20 arrows), Thieves' tools, Dagger, Burglar's pack, Small knife, Map of city, Pet mouse, Common clothes, 10 gp

Stakeout: Shriveai watches the gate as dusk deepens. Perception 23 (entropy 7).
Findings: shift change creates a short gap; runner unlatches the postern; two-guard patrol cycles every few minutes.

Infiltration: Shriveai times the runner and slips through the postern. Stealth 11 (entropy 8). A guard half-turns at a faint scrape, but the crate stack swallows her in shadow. Boots thump past; one lantern sweeps low.


Briefing: Handler Sable prepped this job before you moved. Slide her forged gate roster page into the quartermaster's ledger so courier Merran can walk out at midnight on a bogus lantern-check detail. Payment: 50 gp and a Black Gull safehouse marker. Failure: Merran is held at dawn and Sable burns your alias.

Current position: Behind the postern crates inside the wall. Two-guard patrol loops every few minutes with lanterns sweeping low; the ledger room sits along the interior hall ahead. The runner who unlatches the postern could return on the next pass.

Character quick ref: AC 15, HP 11/11, Passive Perception 14; Stealth +6, Sleight of Hand +6, Perception +4; Thieves' tools +6, Disguise kit; inventory includes the forged roster page and standard kit.
