DM: Stakeout success. You spot a 30-second gap during the shift change and a runner who briefly unlatches the shadowed postern; two guards circle every few minutes.
Choices:
1) Slip through the postern on the next runner pass (Stealth).
2) Create a distraction to widen the gap, then dart through.
3) Trail the patrol to pickpocket a key or badge before entering.
