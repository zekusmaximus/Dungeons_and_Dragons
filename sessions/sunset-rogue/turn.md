DM: Briefing set before play: Sable needs her forged gate roster page slipped into the quartermaster's ledger so courier Merran can walk out at midnight on a bogus lantern-check detail. Payment: 50 gp and a Black Gull safehouse marker. Failure: Merran is held at dawn and your alias burns.
Position: Inside the postern, crouched behind crates in deep shadow. Patrol of two guards loops every few minutes; lantern light sweeps the floor. Ledger room doorway is ~20 ft along the interior hall ahead; runner may return to unlatch the postern again.
Character quick ref:
- Shriveai, Elf Rogue 1 | HP 11/11, AC 15, Speed 30 ft | Passive Perception 14
- Abilities: Str 8 (-1), Dex 19 (+4), Con 16 (+3), Int 16 (+3), Wis 15 (+2), Cha 8 (-1)
- Skills/Tools: Stealth +6, Sleight of Hand +6, Perception +4; Thieves' tools +6, Disguise kit
- Gear highlights: Rapier, Shortbow (20 arrows), Thieves' tools, Dagger, Burglar's pack, Forged roster page, 10 gp

Choices:
1) When the patrol rounds the far corner, slip to the ledger door and work the lock to plant the page quietly.
2) Toss a pebble to draw them toward the outer crates, then rush the ledger desk and swap the page fast.
3) Shadow the patrol briefly to confirm their rotation and snag keys or notes before approaching the ledger.
4) Abort and back out through the postern to regroup with Sable before the midnight deadline.
