DM: You slide through as the runner unlatches the postern. Stealth 11 (entropy 8). A guard half-turns at the sound, but you’re behind crates in deep shadow. Lantern light sweeps low; boots pass close.
Choices:
1) Stay frozen until the patrol clears, then move deeper.
2) Toss a small pebble to redirect attention before slipping away.
3) Shadow the patrol from behind the crates to tail them inside.
4) Retreat quietly back out if the window stays open.
