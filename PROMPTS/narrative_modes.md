# Narrative Modes

- Cinematic: punchy visuals, quick cuts, and momentum.
- Novelistic: deep interiority and descriptive pacing.
- Minimalist: sparse, focused beats with only essentials.
- Journalistic: factual tone noting sources and consequences.
- Heroic: valiant deeds, larger-than-life stakes.
- Folk-tale: rhythmic, archetypal, and moral-laden narration.

Choose a mode per scene and align tone, beats, and rumor coloration accordingly.
