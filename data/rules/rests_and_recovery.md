# Rests and Recovery (SRD Excerpt)

## Short Rest
- A short rest is at least 1 hour of downtime.
- You can spend Hit Dice to regain HP.

## Long Rest
- A long rest is at least 8 hours of downtime.
- You regain all HP and up to half your total Hit Dice.
- You regain expended spell slots according to your class.

## Death Saves
- At 0 HP you are unconscious and must make death saves.
- Roll a d20 at the start of your turn; 10+ is a success, 9 or less is a failure.
- Three successes stabilize you; three failures mean death.
- A natural 20 restores 1 HP; a natural 1 counts as two failures.
