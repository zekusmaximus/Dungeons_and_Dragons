# Spellcasting Basics (SRD Excerpt)

## Casting a Spell
- A spell has a casting time, range, and components.
- If a spell requires concentration, you can concentrate on only one spell at a time.

## Concentration
- Taking damage forces a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.
- DC is 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher.
- You lose concentration if you cast another concentration spell or are incapacitated.

## Spell Slots
- Casting a spell uses a slot of the spell's level or higher.
- Cantrips do not use spell slots.

## Targets and Line of Sight
- You must have a clear path to the target unless the spell says otherwise.
- If a target is behind total cover, it cannot be targeted.
