# Combat Actions (SRD Excerpt)

## Action Economy
- On your turn you can move and take one action.
- You can also take one bonus action if a feature or spell allows it.
- You can take one reaction per round, used outside your turn.

## Common Actions
- Attack: make one melee or ranged attack.
- Cast a Spell: cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action.
- Dash: gain extra movement equal to your speed this turn.
- Disengage: your movement does not provoke opportunity attacks this turn.
- Dodge: attacks against you have disadvantage until your next turn; you have advantage on Dex saves.
- Help: give an ally advantage on a check or attack if you can assist.
- Hide: attempt a Stealth check to become hidden.
- Ready: prepare an action with a trigger; spend your reaction when it occurs.
- Search: make a Perception or Investigation check.
- Use an Object: interact with an object that requires your action.

## Opportunity Attacks
- When a hostile creature you can see leaves your reach, you can use your reaction to make one melee attack.
