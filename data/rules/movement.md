# Movement and Terrain (SRD Excerpt)

- A creature's speed is how far it can move on its turn. Moving through **difficult terrain** costs an extra foot for each foot moved (effectively halving speed).
- You can break up movement with actions. Standing from prone costs half your speed.
- Creatures can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is two sizes larger or smaller.
